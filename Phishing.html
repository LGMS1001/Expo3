            <br>
            <center><h3>What is Phishing?</h3></center>
            <p>Phishing is the crime of tricking people into sharing sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Phishing is a computer term that distinguishes a set of techniques that seek to deceive a victim by gaining their trust by posing as a trusted person, company or service (trusted third party identity theft), to manipulate them and make them perform actions that you shouldn't do.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whoever practices phishing is called a phisher.</p>

            <center><i>Adam Kujawa, Director de Malwarebytes Labs.</i></center>

            <p>The common denominator of all phishing attacks is the use of a fraudulent pretext to acquire valuable data.</p>

            <br>

            <center><h3>Spear phishing</h3></center>
            <p>While most phishing campaigns send mass emails to as many people as possible, spear phishing is a targeted attack. Spear phishing targets a specific person or organization, often with content tailored to the victim. Requires pre-attack reconnaissance to uncover names, titles, email addresses, and the like. Hackers search the Internet to match this information with what they have learned about the target's professional colleagues, along with the names and professional relationships of key employees in their organizations. With this, the phishing author creates a credible email.</p>

            <center><h3>Cloning Phishing</h3></center>
            <p>In this attack, criminals make a copy, or clone, of previously sent legitimate emails that contain a link or attachment. The phisher then replaces the links or attachments with malicious content disguised to impersonate the real thing. Unsuspecting users click on the link or open the attachment, often allowing their systems to be taken over. The phishing perpetrator can then falsify the victim's identity to impersonate a trusted sender to other victims from the same organization.</p>

            <center><h3>419/Nigerian Scams</h3></center>
            <p>A lengthy phishing email from someone claiming to be a Nigerian prince is one of the oldest scams on the internet. According to Wendy Zamora, Head of Content at Malwarebytes Labs, “The Nigerian prince phishing comes from a person claiming to be a government official or member of a royal family who needs help transferring millions of dollars from Nigeria. The email is marked as "urgent" or "private" and its sender asks the recipient to provide a bank account number to send the funds to a safe place.
            <br>
            <br>
            The number “419” is associated with this scam. It refers to the section of the Nigerian penal code that deals with fraud, charges and penalties for violators.</p>

            <center><h3>Phone phishing</h3></center>
            <p>With phone phishing attempts, sometimes called voice phishing or “vishing,” the phisher calls claiming to represent your local bank, the police or even the IRS. Next, they scare you with some kind of problem and insist that you fix it immediately by providing their account information or paying a fine. They usually ask you to pay with a bank transfer or prepaid cards, because they are untraceable.
            <br>
            <br>
            SMS phishing, or “smishing,” is the evil twin of vishing, which performs the same type of scam (sometimes with a malicious embedded link to click) via an SMS text message.</p>

            <center><h3>How to identify a phishing attack?</h3></center>
            <p>The email makes an offer that seems too good to be true.
            <br>
            You recognize the sender, but it's someone you don't deal with.
            <br>
            The message sounds scary.
            <br>
            The message contains unexpected or strange attachments.
            <br>
            The message contains links that seem a bit strange.</p>
            <br>

            <center><h3>How to protect yourself from phishing?</h3></center>
            <p>Do not open emails from senders you are not familiar with.
            <br>
            Don't click on a link within an email unless you know exactly where it takes you.
            <br>
            To apply that layer of protection, if you receive an email from a source you are unsure about, manually navigate to the provided link by typing the legitimate website address into your browser.
            <br>
            Look for the digital certificate of the website.
            <br>
            If you are asked to provide sensitive information, check that the URL of the page begins with "HTTPS" instead of just "HTTP". The "S" stands for "safe." It's not a guarantee that a site is legitimate, but most legitimate sites use HTTPS because it's more secure. HTTP sites, even legitimate ones, are vulnerable to hackers.
            <br>
            If you suspect an email is not legitimate, select a name or part of the message text and take it to a search engine to see if there are any known phishing attacks using the same methods.
            <br>
            Hover your mouse cursor over the link to see if it's legitimate.</p>
